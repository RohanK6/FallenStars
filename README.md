# FallenStars
A program that parses NASA's Meteorite Landing data set and allows for users through the command line to search for Meteorites based on requested masses, years, or locations

Every year there are numerous meteorites entering Earth's atmosphere. In this project, I designed a tool for finding these fallen stars (or rather finding locations at which they were found for the first time). 

The goal of this programming project is for me to become more familiar with:

- working with multi-file programs
- reading data from input files
- using and understanding command line arguments
- working with large data sets
- using the ArrayList class
- writing classes
- implementing your own linked list
- working with existing code
- extending existing classes (inheritance)
- parsing data
- working with exception handling

The data set can be found on NASA's website: https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh
